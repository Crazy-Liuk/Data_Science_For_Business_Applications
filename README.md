## Final Assignment: Exploring the Dynamics of the Music Industry based on Genius and Spotify Data

This project aims at examining the music industry to provide actionable insights for involved artists. It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to be discovered by listeners and the costs of being promoted are high. To address this problem, this analysis investigates what makes a song popular, how the industry is organized, and which themes predominantly occur in the lyrics. The analysis’ underlying data is fetched from the APIs of Spotify and Genius and thereafter analyzed with methods from the areas of machine learning, network analysis, and natural language processing.
